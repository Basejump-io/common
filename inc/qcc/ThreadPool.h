 * A class in the spirit of the Java Runnable object that is used to define an

 * In order to ask the ThreadPool to execute a task, inherit from the Runnable
 * class and provide a Run() method.
 *
 * Typically one extends the Runnable object with member data corresponding to
 * the deferred variables needed by the Run() method.  This kind of object is
 * called a closure.  Since the data must be kept outside of the context of the
 * function or method that asks for execution of the Runnable, it must be kept
 * on the heap.
 *
 * The AllJoyn common OS abstractions library provides a ManagedObj (similar to
 * smart pointers but using references) to help with this kind of need, but it
 * has problems if you want to cast from one kind of ManagedObj to another (see
 * the single parameter constructor and explicit call to the destructor of the
 * enclosed type.  Since we need the cast behavior, we use the Ptr intrusive
 * smart pointer class to manage our runnable closures.

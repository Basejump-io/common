//
// Sidebar on general functionality:
//
// We need to provide a way to get a list of interfaces on the system.  We need
// to be able to find interfaces irrespective of whether or not they are up.  We
// also need to be able to deal with multiple IP addresses assigned to
// interfaces, and also with IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time.
//
// There are a bewildering number of ways to get information about network
// devices in Windows.  Unfortunately, most of them only give us access to pieces
// of the information we need; and different versions of Windows keep info in
// different places.  That makes this code somewhat surprisingly complicated.
//
// Since our client is probably in opening separate sockets on each
// interface/address combination as they become available, we organize the
// output as a list of interface/address combinations instead of the more
// OS-like way of providing a list of interfaces each with an associated list of
// addresses.
//
// This file consists of a number of utility functions that are used to get at
// other OS-dependent C functions and is therefore actually a C program written
// in C++.  Because of this, the organization of the module is in the C idiom,
// with the lowest level functions appearing first in the file, leading toward
// the highest level functions in a bottom-up fashion.

//
// There are two fundamental pieces to the puzzle we want to solve.  We need
// to get a list of interfaces on the system and then we want to get a list
// of all of the addresses on those interfaces.
//
// We don't want to force our clients to think like an OS, so we are going go do
// a "join" of these two functions in the sense of a database join in order to
// put all of the information into a convenient form.  We can use interface
// index to do the "join."  This is the internal function that will provide the
// interface information.
//
// One of the fundamental reasons that we need to do this complicated work is so
// that we can provide a list of interfaces (links) on the system irrespective
// of whether or not they are up or down or what kind of address they may have
// assigned *IPv4 or IPv6).
//
// Linux systems specifically arrange for separating out link layer and network
// layer information, but Windows does not.  Windows is more friendly to us in
// that it provides most of what we want in one place.  The problem is "most."
// We have to jump through some hoops because various versions of Windows return
// different amounts of what we need.
//
// In order to keep the general behavior consistent with the Posix implementation
// we group returned interface/address combinations sorted by address family.  Thus
// we provide this function which returns entries of a given IP address family
// (AF_INET or AF_INET6).

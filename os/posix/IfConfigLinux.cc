// This is supposed to be the Posix version of our OS abstraction library.
// Unfortunately there are a number of functions which we must use, but which
// are not covered under the Posix specs.  Of course, since they are not
// defined, different systems will implement them differently.  This is
// especially apparent in when one looks at the BSD-derived network stack of the
// Darwin operating system.
//
// Unlike Linux, Darwin does not implement Netlink sockets, but does provide the
// functionality we need in different ways.  Additionally, many of the definitions
// are simply not provided in Darwin.  Rather than invent a new subcategory of
// capabilities within the Posiz OS_GROUP, we just "switch" on the particular
// specific OS.
//
// So, we expect the IfConfig functionality to be provided in a separate file
// (IfConfigDarwin.cc) using the completely different mechanisms of that OS under
// the inverse of the ifdef below.

// Sidebar on general functionality and Netlink Sockets:
//
// We need to provide a way to get a list of interfaces on the system.  We need
// to be able to find interfaces irrespective of whether or not they are up.  We
// also need to be able to deal with multiple IP addresses assigned to
// interfaces, and also with IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time.
//
// There are a bewildering number of ways to get information about network
// devices in Linux.  Unfortunately, most of them only give us access to pieces
// of the information we need.  For example, the ioctl SIOCGIFCONF belongs to
// the IP layer and only returns information about IFF_UP interfaces that have
// assigned IP address.  Furthermore, it only returns information about IPv4
// addresses.  Since we need IPv6 addresses, and also interfaces that may not
// have a currently assigned IP address, this won't work.  The function
// getifaddrs() works on Linux, but isn't available on Android since the header
// is private and excludes information we need.  User-space tools are even
// different on different platforms, with ifconfig returning both IPv4 and IPv6
// addresses on Linux but only IPv4 addresses on Android.  Windows is from
// another planet.
//
// One command that pretty much works the same on Android and generic Linux
// is "ip ad sh" which gives us exactly what we want.  This is from the iproute2
// package which uses netlink sockets, which is the new super-whoopty-wow
// control plane for networks in Linux-based systems.  We use netlink sockets
// to get what we want in Linux and Android.  Of course, as you may expect,
// libnetlink is not available on Android so we get to use low-level netlink
// sockets.  This is a bit of a pain, but is manageable since we really need
// so little information.
//
// Netlink has become a rather generic way to transfer information from kernel
// space to user space in Linux.  Netlink is a datagram-oriented service using
// the BSD sockets interface.  There are a number of communication families
// associated with Netlink.  We are concerned with the NETLINK_ROUTE family
// here.  According to the NETLINK(7) manpage, the NETLINK_ROUTE family receives
// routing and link updates and may be used to modify the routing tables (both
// IPv4 and IPv6), IP addresses, link parameters, neighbor setups, queueing
// disciplines, traffic classes and packet classifiers (see rtnetlink(7)).
//
// Since our client is probably in opening separate sockets on each
// interface/address combination as they become available, we organize the
// output as a list of interface/address combinations instead of the more
// OS-like way of providing a list of interfaces each with an associated list of
// addresses.
//
// This file consists of a number of utility functions that are used to get at
// other OS-dependent C functions and is therefore actually a C program written
// in C++.  Because of this, the organization of the module is in the C idiom,
// with the lowest level functions appearing first in the file, leading toward
// the highest level functions in a bottom-up fashion.
